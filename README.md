# Jffy Lang

_JFF Programming Language_

_Pronounced however you'd like; some suggestions: "Jeffy lang", "Jiffy lang"_

Until further notice, this language is written expressly following Robert Nystrom's
Book: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
I may make changes, if there is something I feel like implementing beyond what is
in the book. Those may or may not be well documented.

The book recommends following along in Java to write the interpreter, or refer 
to other people's interpretations in the language of your choice. I'm doing 
neither as I want to challenge myself. 

The interpreter and initial compiler will be written in Go, later the intention
is to rewrite both in Jffy. 

This language is being made _Just For Fun_, it is released under the MIT Licence.
